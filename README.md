# Kaiju Homecoming

This game was created by Paul Gestwicki and Alex Gestwicki as part of
[Global Game Jam 2019](https://www.globalgamejam.org/2019). The theme of the
jam was "What home means to you." 

The game was created using [Unreal Engine 4.21](https://www.unrealengine.com). 
The `ToImport` folder contains all the assets used in the project except for
those from the UE4 Starter Content.
